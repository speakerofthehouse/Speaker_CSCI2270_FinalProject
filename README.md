# Speaker_CSCI2270_FinalProject

This project is designed to model, in a way, a basic D&D game structure. What it does is it builds a few connecting and non connection rooms and the user's objective is to get to the final room and"rescue the princes." The rooms are created and connected through the creation and connection of nodes. The 10 functions that are required in this assignment will come out to be the createnode function and a different function for each room. All of the room functions will be different because of the connections between rooms; however, some rooms will also have tasks for the user to complete before they can move on, such as answering riddles. This project also heavily requires on userinputs and menus for the user to select from.
